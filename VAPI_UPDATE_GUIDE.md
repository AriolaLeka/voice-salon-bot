## üß™ **Step 3: Test the Agent**

After updating, test with these questions:

2. "I would like the options of manicures, please."
3. "What eyelash options do you have?"
4. "What are your hours?"
5. "Where are you located?"
6. "I want to book an appointment for tomorrow at 2 PM"

### **Spanish Tests:**
1. "¬øQu√© servicios ofrecen?"
2. "¬øQu√© opciones de manicura tienen?"
3. "¬øQu√© opciones de pesta√±as tienen?"
4. "¬øCu√°les son sus horarios?"
5. "¬øD√≥nde est√°n ubicados?"
6. "Me gustar√≠a reservar una cita para ma√±ana a las 2 de la tarde"

## üîß **Step 4: Troubleshooting**

### **If Functions Still Don't Work:**
1. Check that all URLs are correct
2. Verify parameter names match exactly
3. Test APIs directly with curl commands
4. Check deployment status

### **If Appointment Booking Fails:**
1. Verify Google Calendar credentials
2. Check that service account has "Editor" role
3. Test calendar API directly

## üìû **Need Help?**

If you encounter any issues:
1. Test the APIs directly using the curl commands
2. Check the deployment logs
3. Verify the Google Calendar setup

The APIs are working perfectly - we just need to get the Vapi.ai agent using the correct configuration!
